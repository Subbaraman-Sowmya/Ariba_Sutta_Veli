# Ariba_Sutta_Veli
# Ariba Sutta Veli: Data Purifier
*Transforming Chaos into Cloud-Ready Insights*

## The Concept
"Sutta Veli" represents a state of absolute clarity. In the context of Ariba Cloud, this project demonstrates how Python can be used as a 'Digital Washerman' to cleanse unstructured data before it enters the global supply chain.

## Features
- **Data Normalization:** Strips 'Dark Matter' (null values/noise) from inputs.
- **Secure Handshake:** Integrated via SSH with GitHub for secure deployment.
- **Efficiency:** Lightweight logic designed for high-frequency cloud integrations.

## Execution
```bash
python3 sutta_veli.py
